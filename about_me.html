School is boring

    <h1>About me </h1>
    <p>My full name is Kevin Michael Allred. I am 15 and am in the 9th grade at Grandview High School. I have 4 siblings; 3 brothers and 1 sister. I live in Colorado.

</p>


    <h2>Church </h2>
    <p>
Currently, I am called as 1st counselor in the Teachers Quorum, the only calling I have ever had is 1st counselor. We have an average sized quorum of 7 members. The president is gone often which leave me in charge most of the time.

</p>
<h2>School</h2>

<p>
I'm currently a freshman attending Grandview. I am in choir and sing bass and low baritone. I am also taking Chinese. My other classes include Adventure Ed, Chemistry, Geometry, Geography, and English.
</p>
<h2>At home</h2>
<p>
My two favorite things in the world are food and sleep which come before anything else.
